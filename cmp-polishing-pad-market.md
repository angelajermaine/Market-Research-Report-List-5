<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMP Polishing Pad Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard CMP Pads</li><li>Soft CMP Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMP polishing pads are crucial in the semiconductor manufacturing process, with two main types: hard and soft pads. Hard CMP pads are designed for aggressive material removal and are typically used for polishing harder wafers, providing a consistent surface finish. In contrast, soft CMP pads conform better to the wafer's surface, enhancing planarity and reducing defects during polishing of softer materials. The choice between hard and soft pads depends on the specific requirements of the application and desired outcomes.</p></p>
