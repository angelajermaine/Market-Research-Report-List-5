<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mucopolysaccharidosis Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intracerebroventricular (ICV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) treatment market is categorized into two main types: intravenous (IV) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) therapies. IV treatments involve administering medications directly into the bloodstream, allowing for systemic distribution and management of symptoms associated with MPS. On the other hand, ICV therapies deliver treatments directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, targeting central nervous system manifestations of the condition. Each method offers distinct advantages depending on the specific MPS type and targeted symptoms, shaping treatment efficacy and patient outcomes.</p></p>
