<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CSF External Drainage Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Ventricular Drainage (EVD) Systems</li><li>Lumbar Drainage (LD) Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) external drainage systems encompass two main types: External Ventricular Drainage (EVD) systems and Lumbar Drainage (LD) systems. EVD systems are primarily used to manage intracranial pressure by draining excess CSF directly from the ventricles in the brain, often during neurosurgery or for treating conditions like hydrocephalus. Conversely, Lumbar Drainage systems are utilized to drain CSF from the spinal canal, typically to relieve pressure, manage spinal fluid leaks, or facilitate diagnostic procedures. Both are critical for patient management in neurology and neurosurgery.</p></p>
