<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welding Helmets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Welding Helmet</li><li>Auto Darkening Welding Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive welding helmets are traditional helmets with a fixed shade lens that darkens to protect the eyes from the bright light produced during welding. Auto-darkening welding helmets, on the other hand, have a lens that automatically adjusts its shade to protect the eyes from the intense light, providing increased convenience and visibility for the welder. The market for auto-darkening welding helmets has been rapidly growing due to their advanced features and improved safety measures compared to passive welding helmets.</p></p>
