<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Run-flat Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Supporting</li><li>Support Ring System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The run-flat tire market comprises primarily two types: self-supporting systems and support ring systems. Self-supporting tires have reinforced sidewalls that can carry the vehicle's weight even when deflated, allowing for continued driving without immediate tire replacement. In contrast, support ring systems utilize an additional ring structure mounted on the wheel, providing support in case of air loss. Both types enhance safety and convenience, enabling drivers to travel longer distances post-puncture without the need for immediate tire changes.</p></p>
