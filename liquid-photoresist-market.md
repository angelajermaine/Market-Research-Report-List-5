<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Liquid Photoresist market is primarily divided into two types: Positive Photoresist and Negative Photoresist. Positive Photoresist becomes soluble upon exposure to light, allowing the patterned areas to be developed away, which is ideal for creating intricate designs in semiconductor manufacturing. Conversely, Negative Photoresist hardens when exposed to light, making the unexposed areas removable during development, suitable for applications requiring robust patterns. Both types play crucial roles in microfabrication processes in electronics and photonics industries.</p></p>
