<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors market is primarily categorized into two types: Indirect Conversion and Direct Conversion. Indirect Conversion detectors use a two-step process where X-rays are first converted into light, which is then detected by a sensor. This method often utilizes materials like cesium iodide or gadolinium oxysulphide. In contrast, Direct Conversion detectors convert X-rays directly into electrical signals using materials like amorphous selenium, offering higher spatial resolution and improved image quality. Both types serve essential roles in digital radiography.</p></p>
