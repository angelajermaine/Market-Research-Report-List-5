<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Black Pellets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Black pellets are a type of biomass fuel produced through advanced thermal processes, offering higher energy density and improved handling compared to traditional wood pellets. The market is segmented by production methods, primarily **torrefaction** and **steam explosion (SE)**. Torrefaction involves heating biomass in a low-oxygen environment, creating a dry, brittle, and energy-dense product. Steam explosion uses high-pressure steam to break down biomass fibers, resulting in pellets with enhanced durability and combustion properties. Both methods cater to industries seeking efficient, sustainable, and carbon-neutral energy solutions.</p></p>
