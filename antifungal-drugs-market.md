<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antifungal Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Azoles</li><li>Echinocandins</li><li>Polyenes</li><li>Allyamines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antifungal drugs market is segmented into four main types: Azoles, Echinocandins, Polyenes, and Allyamines. Azoles, such as fluconazole, inhibit fungal cell membrane synthesis, making them widely used. Echinocandins, like caspofungin, target the fungal cell wall, providing an effective treatment for invasive infections. Polyenes, such as amphotericin B, disrupt cell membrane integrity, often used in severe cases. Allyamines, including terbinafine, are effective against dermatophyte infections and work by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Each type serves distinct therapeutic needs.</p></p>
