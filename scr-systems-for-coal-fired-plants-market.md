<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SCR Systems for Coal-fired Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anhydrous Ammonia SCR Systems for Coal-fired Plants</li><li>Aqueous Ammonia SCR Systems for Coal-fired Plants</li><li>Ureas SCR Systems for Coal-fired Plants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) systems for coal-fired plants utilize different ammonia sources to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. Anhydrous ammonia SCR systems operate with concentrated ammonia, providing efficient NOx reduction but requiring careful handling due to toxicity. Aqueous ammonia SCR systems use diluted ammonia, offering safer handling and a more manageable storage solution, though they may require larger volumes. Urea SCR systems employ urea as a nitrogen source, converting it to ammonia in situ, making it user-friendly while effectively combating NOx emissions in coal-fired operations.</p></p>
