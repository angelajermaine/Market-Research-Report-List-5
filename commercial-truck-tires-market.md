<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Truck Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diagonal Tires</li><li>Radial Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial truck tire market primarily features two types: diagonal (bias-ply) and radial tires. Diagonal tires are constructed with crisscrossed layers of rubber-coated fabric plies, offering durability and resistance to cuts, making them suitable for off-road or heavy-load applications. Radial tires have steel belts and plies running perpendicular to the tread, providing better fuel efficiency, longer tread life, and improved handling on highways. Radial tires dominate the market due to their performance advantages, while diagonal tires remain niche for specific rugged-use scenarios.</p></p>
