<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Suction Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Suction Catheter</li><li>Closed Suction Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical suction catheters market consists of two main types: open suction catheters and closed suction catheters. Open suction catheters are used for direct, temporary airway management and require disconnection from the ventilator, potentially increasing the risk of infection. Closed suction catheters, on the other hand, offer a more sterile and continuous suction system, allowing for airway clearance without disconnecting from the ventilator, thereby minimizing infection risk. Both types serve critical roles in respiratory care and patient safety.</p></p>
