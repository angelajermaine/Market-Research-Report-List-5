<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noise Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The noise barrier market consists of two primary types: ground-mounted and structure-mounted noise barriers. Ground-mounted noise barriers are installed alongside roads or highways, providing sound attenuation by blocking noise from vehicles or industrial activities. They are typically built from materials like concrete or timber and are designed for various environmental conditions. Structure-mounted noise barriers, on the other hand, are affixed to buildings, bridges, or other structures to reduce noise intrusion in urban areas, enhancing acoustic comfort for occupants and nearby residents.</p></p>
