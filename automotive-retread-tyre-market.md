<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Retread Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre Cure</li><li>Mold Cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive retread tyre market offers two main types: pre-cure and mold cure. Pre-cure retreads involve applying a pre-cured tread rubber to a prepared tyre casing, allowing for flexibility in tread design and faster production times. Mold cure retreads, on the other hand, utilize a mould to bond new tread rubber to the casing, typically providing a more uniform finish and potentially greater durability. Both methods extend the life of tyres while promoting sustainability in the automotive industry.</p></p>
